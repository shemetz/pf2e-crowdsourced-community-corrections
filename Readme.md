# Features

This module is in **EXPERIMENTAL** state, not yet ready for general use and not yet submitted to the general listing.

When enabled, open the settings and find the Corrections Menu inside the module settings. That menu opens up a big
mini-spreadsheet where you can choose your minimum numbers to filter through the list, and then can click a button to
apply the corrections (patching a few dozen compendium entries).

This will last until a system update, which will revert these changes and require doing it again (potentially also
requiring this module to update and avoid breaking things).
