Phantasmal Doorknob,,Treasure Vault pg. 127,"""Overpowered""",The Greater and Major versions of this item blind the target on each crit without a saving throw,3,"pretty much every mention of this item online says it's ""strong"", ""busted"", ""overpowered"", etc",2,"Remove the critical hit upgrades - keep it as dazed on crits (or, only blind lower level creatures)",3,,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/15wm9mi/lesser_talked_about_consumables_or_items_that_can/jx1u7fi/

Pin to the Spot,,All or Nothing pg. 79,"""Overpowered""",Seems too strong!  2 actions to attack and restrain on a hit,3,"see discussions elsewhere, people have argued about this",2,"Replace ""the target is also restrained as if you had critically succeeded at an Athletics check to Grapple"" with ""The target becomes off-guard and immobilized until the start of your next turn""",2,hard to tell what fix would be balanced,,,,,,,,,
Cassisian Helmet,,Treasure Vault pg. 151,"""Overpowered""",Seems too strong!  +1 status bonus to defenses against almost all enemies,2,"it's about as good as ""+1 Resilient"" armor, which costs more than twice, and that's before you add in the stacking and the eyebeams",2,"ban this item (note: it's already ""PFS limited"")",2,"with the Remaster, ""evil"" creatures won't exist for much longer, so this problem actually solves itself",https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1252fo6/have_i_been_sleeping_on_cassisian_helmets/,,,,,,,,
Fire Shield,,Player Core pg. 331,"""Underpowered""","Hardness doesn't scale with spell rank, making it a lot less effective at higher ranks",3,"Compare other spells that give the shield block reaction, like Glass Shield or Shielded Arm.  They have hardness increase when heightened.",3,"Add ""the Hardness increases by 4"" to the Heightened +2 section",3,,,,,,,,,,
Evanescent Wings,,Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide,"""Underpowered""","Recent errata standardizes Sprite ancestry flight with other ancestries but removes any ability for them to interact quickly. For example to open a door a Sprite must now take two actions to Fly + Interact, where previously it was only one action if the sprite had this feat.",2,Previous iteration of the feat addressed a common concern of Tiny PCs. Likely that designers overlooked Reach 0 when standardizing these feats.,2,"Combine the two feats by changing the text to:

You've manifested wings that can flutter for brief spurts. You don't need to spend any additional actions to reach something in your space that a Medium creature could reach. For instance, if you wanted to open a cookie jar located four feet off the ground, you only need to spend a single Interact action to do so. When you use Evanescent Wings to flutter to a higher place in your space, your action gains the move trait. You also gain the following action:

Flutter ♦
Frequency once per round
Drawing on your innate magic, you force your wings to carry you further than they normally could. You Fly. If you don’t normally have a fly Speed, you gain a fly Speed of 15 feet for this movement. If you aren’t on solid ground at the end of this movement, you fall.",3,The fix is strictly stronger than the original feat since it just combines them. But it is in-line with the capabilities of all other flying ancestries (limited flight and the ability to reach things near them).,https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6u23n&page=2?The-Start-of-Something-Good-Announcing-Errata#80,,,,,,,,
